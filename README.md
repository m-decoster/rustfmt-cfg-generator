# Rustfmt Config Generator

## Notes

* This repository was created and last updated in 2016 and is very likely outdated.
* I do not recommend deviating (too much) from the default rustfmt settings. A single style for all code bases promotes readability and cooperation.

After reading the above, you are now free to continue to the real README.

## README

This repository contains the code to the Rustfmt Config Generator Website.

This is an unofficial website which allows you to choose from different
values for your Rustfmt configuration file based on code examples.

You do not need to install anything, this is simply a HTML + JavaScript website which is available online (see below).

### Website

The website itself is available [here](https://m-decoster.github.io/rustfmt-cfg-generator/).

### Contributing

Contributions are of course welcome. Not all Rustfmt configuration options
have been implemented yet. If you find one missing, please create an issue.
If you want to implement an option, please add it in `js/options.js` in the
appropriate format.

Along with your contribution, feel free to add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS` file.
